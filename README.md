# centraldogma
DNA parser

This is a SpringBoot application that serves as an educational demonstration of:

* Implementation of a microservice in Kotlin that translates DNA or RNA into its respective amino acid.
* Controllers that handle requests, validation of requests, and response objects.
* Object oriented concepts in Kotlin.

The subject of the demo is based on the central dogma of molecular biology (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology), which describes the process in which DNA base triplets are translated into RNA and then into amino acids.
